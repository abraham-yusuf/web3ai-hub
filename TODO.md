## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY — Sebelum Launch

### 🛡️ Security Hardening (Phase 6)

> Platform punya admin panel + AI API routes — ini kritis sebelum production.

- [x] Rate limiting pada AI routes (`/api/research/assistant`, `/api/learn/chat`, `/api/content/translate`, `/api/admin/learn/*/generate`) — strict 8/min (admin) + normal 30/min (public), shared `rate-limiter.ts`
- [x] CSRF protection untuk admin POST/PUT/DELETE routes — via `proxy.ts` with method check
- [x] Security headers (helmet) — Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security
- [x] API abuse prevention (request throttling, input validation) — rate limiter integrated
- [x] Audit logging untuk admin actions — integrated ke posts, airdrops, tools, faq, glossary actions, `AdminActivity` model di DB
- [x] Admin activity tracking — `AdminActivity` table dengan actor, resource, action, metadata, indexed untuk dashboard

### ⚡ Performance Audit (Phase 6)

> Target Lighthouse 90+ semua metrik.

- [ ] Lighthouse baseline audit (desktop + mobile)
- [ ] JS bundle size audit & optimization
- [ ] Image optimization audit (next/image, WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals measurement & fix
- [ ] Database query optimization — cek N+1 queries (Prisma `tracing`)
- [ ] Edge caching strategy (ISR revalidation times review)
- [ ] Lazy loading improvements

### 🧪 Testing (Phase 6)

> Roadmap target unit + integration + E2E, saat ini hanya test dasar.

- [ ] Unit tests: `lib/ai/providers.ts` (fallback logic, model selection)
- [ ] Unit tests: utility functions (`lib/utils/`, `lib/mdx/`)
- [ ] Integration tests: API routes (`/api/ai/generate`, `/api/ai/chat`, `/api/airdrop/*`)
- [ ] Integration tests: Prisma CRUD operations
- [ ] E2E tests: critical user journeys (Playwright)
  - Blog listing → detail → share
  - Airdrop listing → detail → step tracker
  - AI Tools search → compare
  - Admin login → create post → publish

### 📚 Content Expansion

> Blog cuma 3 post, learn content minimal. Traffic = konten.

- [x] Blog: generate 20+ posts minimal — 60+ MDX posts exist across 4 categories (web3-fundamentals, ai-tutorials, airdrop-guides, opinion-news) × ID+EN
  - 5x Web3 fundamentals (blockchain basics, DeFi intro, NFT guide, wallet setup, gas fees)
  - 5x AI tutorials (prompt engineering, LLM comparison, AI tools review, ChatGPT tips, AI image generation)
  - 5x Airdrop guides (current active airdrops, how to qualify, scam avoidance)
  - 5x Opinion/News (Web3 trends, AI regulation, market analysis)
- [x] Learn: expand Web3 track ke 20+ halaman — 30 pages in content/learn/web3-basics/ (Solidity, DeFi, DAO, NFT, AMM, etc.)
- [x] Learn: expand AI track ke 20+ halaman — 32 pages in content/learn/ai-basics/ (LLM integration, fine-tuning, RAG Production, AI Agents, etc.)

### 📄 Content Workflow Gap (Phase 3)

- [x] AI plagiarism checker — /api/admin/posts/plagiarism-check, Jaccard trigram similarity against all published posts, threshold 30%, returns top 5 matches

> Penting untuk retention di platform learning.

- [x] User profiles (bio, avatar, social links, learning stats) — `/profile/[username]` public page
- [x] Achievement badges (complete track, first post, streak milestones) — `/achievements` gallery + `/admin/achievements`
- [x] Learning XP system (XP per lesson/quiz, level progression) — `src/lib/gamification.ts` with xpToLevel formula
- [x] Referral system (invite link, bonus XP) — `/api/gamification/referral`, 50 XP both parties
- [x] Community leaderboard (weekly/monthly) — `/leaderboard` top 50 + podium
- [x] Daily streak system (consecutive day tracking, streak rewards) — `/api/gamification/streak` + StreakWidget

### 🛠️ AI Tools Directory (Phase 5)

- [x] Advanced filtering (by features, integrations, languages, pricing type, platform) — multi-select filter chips, dynamic Prisma query
- [x] AI recommendation engine — trending API (`/api/tools/trending`) based on viewCount + bookmarks + rating
